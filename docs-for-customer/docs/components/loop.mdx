## Description

The **loop** component allows you to loop over a list of items or loop a specific number of times depending on which action is selected.
This is handy if you have a set of files or pieces of data to process.
The loop component can be set up execute a series of actions on each file or item in a list.

The array that is looped over can contain numbers, strings, or complex objects, but all items in the array should be of the same type.

For each iteration of the loop, the loop provides two variables - `currentItem` and `index`, which contains the item currently being looped over, and the zero-indexed number of the item respectively.
For example, if your array looked like this:

```json
[
    {
        "firstName": "Bob",
        "lastName": "Smith"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "Vince",
        "lastName": "Nguyen"
    }
    {
        "firstName": "Sally",
        "lastname": "Jones"
    }
]
```

The second iteration of the loop would have a `currentItem` of `{ "firstName": "Vince", "lastName": "Nguyen"}`, and an `index` of `1`.

Looping is particularly useful for looping over files.
For example, if you used the Amazon S3 [listObjects](components/aws-s3.mdx#listobjects) action to list objects in an S3 bucket, you can use a loop to perform a series of actions on each of those S3 objects.

## Actions

<div id="breakloop" />

### Break Loop

Breaks out of the current Loop, causing execution to resume after the containing Loop. | <small><b>key: breakLoop</b></small>

<ComponentInputsTable inputs={[]} />

<hr className="componentActionSeparator" />

<div id="loopntimes" />

### Loop N Times

Loops over the the steps in the loop N times, or until a loop break occurs. | <small><b>key: loopNTimes</b></small>

<ComponentInputsTable
  inputs={[
    {
      key: "iterationCount",
      label: "Number of Iterations",
      placeholder: "# of Iterations",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      default: "1000",
      comments: "The number of times to execute the steps in the loop.",
    },
  ]}
/>

<hr className="componentActionSeparator" />

<div id="loopoveritems" />

### Loop Over Items

Loops over items, applies each step in sequence, and returns a new collection of the results. Items must be an Array or Object. | <small><b>key: loopOverItems</b></small>

<ComponentInputsTable
  inputs={[
    {
      key: "items",
      label: "Items",
      placeholder: "Items",
      type: "data",
      required: true,
      comments:
        "These are the items to loop over. This must be an Array (list) or Object, and should be a reference to a previous step's results.",
    },
  ]}
/>
