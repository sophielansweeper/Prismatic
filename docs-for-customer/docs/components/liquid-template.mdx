## Description

The [LiquidJS Templating Engine](https://liquidjs.com/) is a simple, expressive and safe templating system.
This component takes a template and data as inputs, and outputs a rendered document formatted by the template and populated with the data provided.

For example, suppose you have data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "completed_tasks": ["Groceries", "Laundry", "Exercise"],
  "incomplete_tasks_count": 5
}
```

And suppose you have a template that looks like this:

```liquid
{{ completed_tasks | size }} tasks were completed today, which include:
{%- for completed_task in completed_tasks -%}
 - {{ completed_task }}
{%- endfor -%}

There are {{ incomplete_tasks_count }} yet to complete.
```

Passing in that data into that template, your result would read:

```
3 tasks were completed today, which include:
 - Groceries
 - Laundry
 - Exercise

There are 5 yet to complete.
```
