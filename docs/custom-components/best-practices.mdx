This article contains recommendations, tips and tricks for building and testing reusable custom components.

## Determine the type of connection to use

When examining a third-party's API documentation, take note of how they recommend authenticating with their API.
If the third-party app supports multiple connection mechanisms (like OAuth 2.0 and a personal access token), consider a few factors when choosing which one(s) to support in your component.

- The most prevalent auth type for integrations is the OAuth 2.0 auth code flow, and it's also the simplest for end users to understand.
  With the auth code flow, end users click a single "connect" button in the config wizard which takes them to a consent screen in the third party.
  Prismatic takes care of the rest (auth code exchange, token refresh, etc).
  OAuth provides "scoped" permissions, meaning you don't have access to do everything the user who authenticated can do - only a subset of actions that your customer grants you permission to perform.
- An alternative to the OAuth 2.0 auth code flow is the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow (also sometimes called machine-to-machine M2M OAuth).
  If the third-party app supports the client credentials flow, then your customers can log in to the third-party app, create a "system" user, and generate a client ID / client secret key pair.
  This requires a little more work on the customer's part but provides the same "scoped" access to the third-party, and the credential is generally not tied to a specific user.
- Many apps have "API Key" access of some sort, where a customer generates a personal access token in the app and pastes the token into a config wizard.
  Like the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow, API key requires a little more work on the customer user's part, and it's helpful to include some helper text in the comments of the input:

  ```ts title="Provide helper text for connection inputs" {11-12}
  export const acmeApiKey = connection({
    key: "acmeApiKey",
    label: "Acme API Key",
    inputs: {
      apiKey: {
        label: "API Key",
        placeholder: "API Key",
        type: "string",
        required: true,
        shown: true,
        comments:
          "To generate an Acme API key, log in to Acme and open settings > security > personal access token.",
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- Whenever possible, avoid authenticating with basic auth (i.e. collecting your customer's username and password).
  Instances that authenticate with basic auth are susceptible to breaking if the customer user changes their password.

### Handle multiple connection types in a custom component

It's possible to support multiple connection types in a custom component.
Suppose that your component has an `acmeOauth2` connection as well as a personal access token `acmePat` connection type.
Build a generic function that takes a connection, and returns an authenticated HTTP client that sets an `Authorization` header based on that connection type:

```ts title="Generic HTTP client that supports multiple connection types"
import { Connection } from "@prismatic-io/spectral";
import { createClient } from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/clients/http";
import { acmePat, acmeOauth2 } from "./connections";

export const createAcmeClient = async (connection: Connection) => {
  switch (connection.key) {
    case acmePat.key:
      return createClient({
        baseUrl: "https://app.acme.com/api/1.0",
        headers: {
          // Connection input fields are accessible through the fields property
          authorization: `Bearer ${connection.fields.apiKey}`,
        },
      });
    case acmeOauth2.key:
      return createClient({
        baseUrl: "https://app.acme.com/api/1.0",
        headers: {
          // OAuth access tokens are stored in a tokens property
          authorization: `Bearer ${connection.token?.access_token}`,
        },
      });
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported connection type: ${connection.key}`);
  }
};
```

## Pagination in custom components

Every app implements pagination differently.
Some apps require you to pass page number and number of records to return as URL search parameters (i.e. `?page=5&page_size=20`).
In that case, it's your job to keep track of which page you're on.
Others return a "cursor" with the response (either in the body or as a response header).
You can include that cursor with your next request to get another page of results.

As you build an action for an API that paginates, ask yourself this question: _is it reasonable to pull down all records at one time?_.

If the API you're interacting with returns 100 records at a time, for example, and you know that customers never have more than a few hundred records of a particular type, it probably makes sense to pack pagination logic into your custom action.
That way, your customers don't need to keep track of page numbers or cursors - your action simply returns all results.
In this example, Airtable returns a JSON payload with an `offset` property and array of `records` that we accumulate in a `do`/`while` loop:

```ts title="Handling pagination within an action"
export interface AirtableRecord {
  id: string;
  createdTime: string;
  fields: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface AirtableRecordResponse {
  offset: string;
  records: AirtableRecord[];
}

const listRecords = action({
  display: {
    label: "List Records",
    description: "List all records inside of the given table",
  },
  inputs: {
    airtableConnection: connectionInput,
    baseId: baseIdInput,
    tableName: tableNameInput,
    view: viewInput,
  },
  perform: async (context, params) => {
    const client = createAirtableClient(params.airtableConnection);

    const records: AirtableRecord[] = [];
    let offset = "";

    do {
      const { data } = await client.get<AirtableRecordResponse>(
        `/v0/${params.baseId}/${params.tableName}`,
        {
          params: {
            view: params.view,
            offset,
          },
        }
      );
      records.push(...data.records);
      offset = data.offset;
    } while (offset);

    return { data: records };
  },
});
```

On the other hand, if you know that your customers have a significant number of records stored in a third-party app (e.g. they have millions of records in their Airtable base), it's more memory-efficient to fetch a page of records at a time, processing each page before fetching the next page.
In that case, we recommend adding `offset`, `cursor`, `page_number`, etc., as inputs of your action, and ensure that your action returns those values for the next iteration.

:::tip parsing link headers
If the API you're working with returns link headers, we recommend the [parse-link-header](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-link-header) package, which can be used to extract the next URL to use when paginating.

## Create a generic HTTP client in your custom component

Your component will contain multiple actions.
To adhere to "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principles, you should create a generic authetnicated HTTP client that all of your actions can reference.

While you can use the built-in NodeJS `fetch` API or any other HTTP client of your choice, we recommend importing the `createClient` function from the custom component SDK.
This function returns an instance of [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) with some defaults that tend to work best in Prismatic.
Additionally, you can flip a `debug` flag to `true` to log out all requests and responses for debugging purposes.

```typescript title="src/client.ts"
import { createClient } from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/clients/http";
import { Connection, util } from "@prismatic-io/spectral";

export function getAcmeErpClient(acmeConnection: Connection) {
  const { apiKey, endpoint } = acmeConnection.fields;

  // Return an HTTP client that has been configured to point
  // towards endpoint URL, and passes an API key as a header
  return createClient({
    baseUrl: util.types.toString(endpoint),
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    },
    debug: false,
  });
}
```

Now, each of our actions simply need to pass in a connection to the `getAcmeErpClient` function, and they'll be able to make HTTP calls to the Acme ERP API.

### Handle errors from your generic HTTP client

If you use the `createClient` HTTP function from the custom component SDK, you can leverage the built-in sibling function `handleErrors`.
When an error is thrown from an action, that error is passed through the `handleErrors` function, which determines if the error originated from an HTTP call.
If it did, additional information is extracted from the error and logged out for debugging purposes.

```ts title="Provide better HTTP errors"
import { handleErrors } from "@prismatic-io/spectral/dist/clients/http";

export default component({
  //...
  hooks: {
    error: handleErrors,
  },
});
```

## Determine when to build data sources

[Data sources](configuration-wizard.mdx#config-variable-data-sources) allow your users to configure instances of your integration based on data stored in their third-party accounts.
For example, after authenticating with Slack, a customer can select one of their Slack channels from a drop-down menu.

When determining what data sources to add to your component, ask yourself:

- **What inputs do my component's actions require**?
  For example, almost every Asana action requires an Asana "Workspace ID".
  It makes sense to create a "Select Workspace" datasource which presents a user with a dropdown menu of workspaces that the user has access to.
- **Does a record type make sense in the context of a config wizard**?
  For example, a customer may have thousands of "leads" in Salesforce.
  It's doubtful that they would want to select a single lead from a dropdown menu when configuring an instance, so a "Select Lead" data source probably doesn't make sense to build.

## Handle webhooks in custom components

If the API you're building a custom component for supports event-driven notifications ([webhooks](webhooks/what-is-a-webhook.mdx)), it's helpful to include actions that subscribe an instance's flow to a webhook.
Generally, we've found that four actions webhook-related actions are helpful to have:

1. **List Webhooks**.
   This action lists all webhooks that are configured in the third-party app.
   We recommend only displaying webhooks that are pointed at the current instance's flows (otherwise, you'll see webhooks that are configured for other applications).
   Check out the example in our [GitHub examples repo](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/blob/2e45a9aa2af25ddb511df364cb29df057367afd5/components/asana/src/actions/webhooks.ts#L55-L73) which demonstrates how to reference `context.webhookUrls` to filter webhooks down to only ones that match your current instance.
2. **Create Webhook**
   This action takes an event (or list of events, like `contact.create`) and a URL, which can be a webhook URL of a sibling flow.
   If an ID of a webhook is returned, this action can return that ID.
   See our [examples repo](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/blob/2e45a9aa2af25ddb511df364cb29df057367afd5/components/asana/src/actions/webhooks.ts#L115-L143) for an example of creating a webhook.
3. **Delete Webhook by ID**
   This action can take an ID of a webhook (fetched by the **List Webhooks** action), and delete that webhook by ID.
4. **Delete Instance Webhooks**
   This is a handy action to include, as it fetches a list of all webhooks in the third-party, filters them down to only webhooks pointed at the current instance, and removes just those webhooks.
   You can leverage `context.webhookUrls` to determine which webhooks to delete.
   Having this logic baked in to a single action can reduce complexity on your component's users.
   Check out our [examples repo](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/blob/2e45a9aa2af25ddb511df364cb29df057367afd5/components/asana/src/actions/webhooks.ts#L176-L204) for an example of a **Delete Instance Webhooks** action.

The above actions assume that an integration builder will create two flows: one that creates webhooks on instance deploy and one that removes webhooks on instance delete.
If you'd like to simply that process for users of your component, you can bake webhook logic into a custom trigger's `onInstanceDeploy` and `onInstanceDelete` functions.
See our [examples repo](https://github.com/prismatic-io/examples/blob/2e45a9aa2af25ddb511df364cb29df057367afd5/components/asana/src/triggers/eventTriggers.ts#L115-L152) for an example of how to create and delete webhooks automatically when an instance is created or deleted.

## Add a "Raw Request" action

If the API that you're building a custom component for is large, with hundreds of endpoints, there's a good chance that users of your custom component only need you to wrap a fraction of those endpoints.
You probably have a good sense of which portions of the API are important to your component's users.
But, what if your component's user needs to reach an endpoint that isn't wrapped in a purpose-built action?

That's where **raw request** actions come in handy.
You can build an action that takes an endpoint as an endpoint and handles the authentication and response on your user's behalf.

See the [Raw Request](raw-request.mdx#building-an-http-raw-request-action-in-your-custom-component) article for an example of a raw request action that leverages the custom component SDK's `sendRawRequest` function.

## Handle complex inputs in a custom action

When an API endpoint that you're wrapping in a custom action expects a simple payload, like

```
POST /widgets

{
  "name": "string",
  "color": "string",
  "quantity": "number"
}
```

it's easy to map each value in the POST request to an input.
Here, we'd create a "name" input, a "color" input, and a "quantity" input.
Then, we'd apply a `clean: util.types.toNumber` clean function to the "quantity" input to ensure it is cast to a number.

But, some endpoints expect complex payloads that may contain arrays of objects with optional properties, etc.

```
POST /widgets
{
  "externalId": "abc-123",
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Variant 1",
      "color": "red",
      "price": {
        "usd": 5,
        "ca": 5.5
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Variant 2",
      "color": "blue",
      "price": {
        "usd": 6
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, it's likely that an integration builder will want to construct a property like `variants` programmatically, and it's probably best to present two inputs, "External ID" which is `type: "string"` and "Variants" which is `type: "code"`.
To accommodate both JSON and JavaScript object inputs, use the `util.types.toObject` function to ensure that what is entered becomes a JavaScript object.
For example,

```ts title="Convert a complex input to an object"
const createWidgets = action({
  display: {
    label: "Create Widgets",
    description: "Create widgets and their variants",
  },
  inputs: {
    connection: connectionInput,
    externalId: input({
      label: "External ID",
      type: "string",
      comments: "The ID stored in Acme for this Widget type",
      clean: util.types.toString,
    }),
    variants: input({
      label: "Variants",
      comments:
        "Variant types of the widget. Ensure you provide an array of variant objects.",
      type: "code",
      language: "json",
      clean: util.types.toObject,
      example: JSON.stringify(
        [
          {
            name: "Variant 1",
            color: "red",
            price: {
              usd: 5,
              ca: 5.5,
            },
          },
          {
            name: "Variant 2",
            color: "blue",
            price: {
              usd: 6,
            },
          },
        ],
        null,
        2
      ),
    }),
  },
  perform: async (context, params) => {
    const client = createAcmeClient(params.connection);
    const { data } = await client.post("/widgets", {
      externalId: params.externalId,
      variants: params.variants,
    });
    return { data };
  },
});
```

## Handle file inputs in a custom component

If your action expects a file as an input, you should expect three types of inputs from your users:

1. Strings, either generated from previous steps or static strings.
   In the case of strings, you should write the string contents to a file via the API.
2. A JavaScript object.
   In this case, the user probably expects that you'll serialize the input to JSON and write the JSON string as the file contents.
3. A file from a previous step.
   This is probably the most common input to expect.
   When binary files are passed between steps, they are passed as JavaScript objects of the form `{ data: Buffer, contentType?: string }`.

In all of these cases, if you pass the input through the `util.types.toData` function, binary files will remain files, strings will be converted to `{ data: Buffer.from(input), contentType: "text/plain" }` and JavaScript objects are converted to `{ data: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(input)), contentType: "application/json"}`.

You can turn the data into a `data`/`contentType` pair and reference each property in your `perform` function:

```ts title="Handle various input types as binary file contents"
const attachFileToAccount = action({
  display: {
    label: "Attach File to Account",
    description: "Upload a file to an account",
  },
  inputs: {
    connection: connectionInput,
    file: input({
      label: "File Attachment",
      type: "data",
      comments: "The file to attach to an account",
      clean: util.types.toData,
    }),
  },
  perform: async (context, params) => {
    const client = createAcmeClient(params.connection);
    const { data: fileData, contentType } = params.file;
    const { data } = await client.post("/accounts/attachments", fileData, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": contentType },
    });
    return { data };
  },
});
```
