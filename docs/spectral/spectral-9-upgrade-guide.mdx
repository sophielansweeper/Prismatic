title: Spectral 9.x Upgrade Guide
description: Upgrade your custom components and code-native integrations from Spectral 8.x to 9.x
---

Spectral 9.x is backwards-compatible with Spectral 8.x for custom component development.
You can safely bump your version of Spectral from 8.x to 9.x without changes to your custom component code.

For [code-native integrations](code-native-integrations.mdx), Spectral 9.x introduces the ability to reference existing components' actions within a code-native flow.
To update a code-native integration to Spectral 9.x, it may be easiest to re-initialize a code-native project, and copy your flows and config wizard code to the new project.
Alternatively, initialize a new project for reference and do the following:

- Copy `.spectral/index.ts` from the new project into your current project
- Copy `.npmrc` from the new project into your current project
- Update `@prismatic-io/spectral` in your `package.json` file to the latest version

A few syntax changes were made between 8.x and 9.x. Namely:

- Flows no longer require `configPage` generics to infer the shape of your config variables. `flow<typeof configPages>()` can be changed simply to `flow()`.
- References to existing components' data sources, connections are now done by installing a component's manifest package into your project.
  See [Using existing components in code-native integrations](code-native-integrations.mdx#using-existing-components-in-code-native-integrations).
- References to existing components' triggers remain the same syntactically.

Visibility of inputs on connections can now be explicitly set. For example, a reference to an existing Slack OAuth connection can now read:

```ts
export const configPages = {
  Connections: configPage({
    tagline: "Authenticate with Slack",
    elements: {
      "Slack OAuth Connection": connectionConfigVar({
        stableKey: "slack-oauth-connection",
        dataType: "connection",
        connection: {
          component: "slack",
          key: "oauth2",
          values: {
            clientId: {
              value: SLACK_CLIENT_ID,
              permissionAndVisibilityType: "organization",
              visibleToOrgDeployer: false,
            },
            clientSecret: {
              value: SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET,
              permissionAndVisibilityType: "organization",
              visibleToOrgDeployer: false,
            },
            signingSecret: {
              value: SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET,
              permissionAndVisibilityType: "organization",
              visibleToOrgDeployer: false,
            },
            scopes: {
              value: "chat:write chat:write.public channels:read",
              permissionAndVisibilityType: "organization",
              visibleToOrgDeployer: false,
            },
          },
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
};
```
