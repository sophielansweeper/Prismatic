title: Spectral 8.x Upgrade Guide
description: Upgrade your custom component from Spectral 7.x to 8.x
---

Spectral 8.x is completely backwards-compatible with Spectral 7.x.
You can safely bump your version of Spectral from 7.x to 8.x without changes to your custom component code.

Spectral 8.x introduced [code-native integrations](code-native-integrations.mdx), which allows you to build integrations entirely in code using the Spectral SDK.
