description: Run the on-prem container on a Windows host
---

The on-prem agent is a Linux-based Docker container, which naturally lends itself well to a Linux host.
For ease of installation we recommend running the on-prem agent on a Linux host.

But, if for compliance or other reasons you are required to run the on-prem agent on a Windows host, you can.
This document calls out considerations for installing the on-prem agent on a Windows host.

## Installing Docker on a Windows host

You have several options for installing Docker on a Windows host.

1. You can run a Linux host in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), and run `docker` within WSL2.
   To install WSL2 on your Windows host, run

   ```
   wsl --install
   ```

   from PowerShell and follow the prompts.
   Once WSL2 is installed, assume the root user with `sudo su` and run

   ```
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

   Then, follow the [steps on Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) to add Docker's aptitude repository and install the latest Docker packages.
   Additionally, install `docker-compose` with

   ```
   apt install docker-compose
   ```

   You can start the docker service as the root user with

   ```
   service docker start
   ```

1. You can download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) for Windows.
   Note that depending on your company's size and other factors, you may need to license Docker Desktop.
   Please consult Docker's licensing information.
1. You can purchase and install the [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/) Docker engine.

## Ensuring containers run on boot on a Windows host

By default, WSL2 and Docker Desktop are not launched until a user has logged in to the Windows host.
This makes maintenance difficult - a system that reboots does not automatically launch WSL2 or Docker Desktop without a manual login.
But you can use Windows scheduled tasks to ensure that WSL2 or Docker Desktop start automatically.

:::note
Regardless of if you use WSL2, Docker Desktop, or another Docker service on your Windows host, please remember to mark your on-prem agent as `restart: always`, and run docker compose in "detached" mode (i.e. `docker-compose up --detach`)
For example,

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml" {10}
services:
  on-prem-agent:
    image: prismaticio/on-prem-agent:latest
    environment:
      PRISMATIC_URL: https://app.prismatic.io
      APP_PORT: 1433
      APP_HOST: 10.0.0.123
      NAME: Acme MS SQL
      REGISTRATION_JWT: eyJ0eXAiOiJK...
    restart: always # Use "always" to start this service when the Docker engine starts
```

To create a new scheduled task, search for "Task Scheduler" from your Windows search bar.

/>

Then, select **Action** > **Create Task**

Within the scheduled task, ensure that **Run whether user is logged on or not** and **Run with highest privileges** are selected.
Give the task an identifiable name and select an appropriate version of Windows for your installation.

### Configuring Docker Desktop to run on boot

Within a new scheduled task's **Triggers** tab, create a new trigger to begin the task **At startup**.
Set the **Delay task for** to **1 minute** and ensure **Enabled** is selected.

<Screenshot
  filename="on-prem-agent-windows/triggers-docker-desktop.png"
  maxWidth="600px"
  alt="Setting up triggers for Docker Desktop"
/>

Under the **Actions** tab, create a new action and start the program `"C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"`

<Screenshot
  filename="on-prem-agent-windows/actions-docker-desktop.png"
  maxWidth="600px"
  alt="Setting up actions for Docker Desktop"
/>

After rebooting your Windows host, you should see Docker Desktop and any containers marked `restart: always` automatically start without user login within a few minutes.

### Ensuring WSL2 to run on boot

Within a new scheduled task's **Triggers** tab, create a new trigger to begin the task **At startup**.
Set the **Delay task for** to **1 minute** and ensure **Enabled** is selected.
Additionally set **Repeat task every** to every couple of minutes for the first 15 minutes.
HyperV may not be ready to start the Docker service one minute after boot and the additional task repeats helps to ensure that the task completes eventually.

<Screenshot
  filename="on-prem-agent-windows/triggers-wsl.png"
  maxWidth="600px"
  alt="Setting up triggers for WSL2"
/>

Under the **Actions** tab, create a new action and start the program `"C:\Program Files\WSL\wsl.exe"`.
Under **Add arguments (optional)** include the arguments:

```
-u root -e sh -c "service docker status || service docker start"
```

<Screenshot
  filename="on-prem-agent-windows/actions-wsl.png"
  maxWidth="600px"
  alt="Setting up actions for WSL2"
/>

This instructs your machine to run `wsl.exe` on boot, and as the root user it will start the `docker` service if it is not already running.
After rebooting your Windows host, you should see WSL, its Docker service, and any containers marked `restart: always` automatically start without user login within a few minutes.
